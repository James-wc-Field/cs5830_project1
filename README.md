#### This assignment is an introductory assignment intended to make sure we are capable of:
- working in a team
- using GitHub
- using the libraries we will need throughout this course
- writing up a report
- analysing the data we find accurately

We analyzed data from baseball records and decided as a team what we wanted to report on.
We then parsed the given csv files and analyzed the data we found. We interpreted the 
data and created useful charts so that we could easily present our discoveries to others.
